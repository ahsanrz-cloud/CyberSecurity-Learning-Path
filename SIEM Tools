Why I’m Learning SIEM

I’m focusing on SIEM because it sits at the heart of modern cybersecurity. My background in RF and networking taught me how systems communicate, but SIEM helps me understand how they behave when something goes wrong. It gives visibility into logs, threats, patterns and anomalies that often go unnoticed.

Learning SIEM lets me:

Make sense of real security events instead of just theory

Build detections that catch suspicious activity early

Understand how attackers move through networks

Strengthen my defensive skills as I work toward a blue-team career path

Combine my networking knowledge with security monitoring and incident response

Tools like Splunk and Security Onion give me a way to practice analysing logs, writing queries, building dashboards and creating detection use cases. It’s a core skill for SOC analysts and anyone serious about defending systems.

This journey is helping me move from traditional engineering to hands-on cybersecurity, with a strong focus on practical detection and response. If you’re also learning SIEM or working on blue-team projects, feel free to connect or share ideas.
