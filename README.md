# My CyberSecurity Journey 

Hi, I’m Syed.
I started my career as an Senior Network/Telecommunication Engineer, working across wired/wireless networks, system integration, and field deployments. I’ve spent years solving real-world connectivity problems, designing reliable network solutions and supporting critical communications for large organisations.

Along the way, I became more interested in the security side of technology — how networks behave under pressure, how systems fail, and how to protect them. That curiosity pushed me deeper into cybersecurity.

I’ve since earned the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) and shifted my learning toward blue-team skills, SIEM, threat detection, Linux, network security fundamentals and hands-on labs. I’m building home labs, experimenting with Splunk, Security Onion, Kali and defensive tooling, and sharing parts of that journey here.

My goals are simple:
Keep learning. Build real skills. Contribute useful tools and notes that can help others starting out.

If you’re exploring networking, RF, blue-team tooling or beginner-friendly cybersecurity paths, feel free to connect.
